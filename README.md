This repository includes several files required to run the Gitlab CI on your GitLab Laravel repository. The Docker container is pre-packaged with Laravel vendor dependecies, which reduces the number of files required to be downloaded. 

It pulls a Docker image from [this repository](https://github.com/GIANTCRAB/php-laravel-env).

## Support

To switch between Laravel versions, change this repository's branch. Master branch will always have the latest image.
